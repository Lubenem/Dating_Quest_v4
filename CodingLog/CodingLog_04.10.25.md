## map
* Please, don't ever remove no docs (.md) without my permission
* I see the map and it's black! Very good! But it is completely static, not interactable, igonres my fingers! The navigation happens instead. Let's completely remove the swipe left-right nav, cause it intersects with map interaction. Maybe we will add it back later.
* Also, the map is not showing my current location even though I've agreed to share it in the popup.
* I didn't rebuild the app after our last changes. Can it be a part of the issue? If so, we can rebuild after you done.

<x> What are my options for the map component?
* Search the web, look for best and common practices for Expo/ReactNative for maps
* We are working on this Expo app #file:Expo_Cursor_DatingQuest 
* Consult the old react project that we are trying to replicate #file:React_Cursor_DatingQuest 
* I want to add another page with the map, just like we have in my old proj
* Let's brainstorm
\
[t] Map | Let's add a Map page
* Keep it simple, no need to imlement everying right away, small but steady steps is the key. If not all map features from the old map are reimplemented right away that's totally fine. Just in the end of your work state what still remains to be done in connection to the maps issue, lay out next steps in text form
* Just add another page, with a map inside of it. Use this map component - Option 2: ExpoMaps!
* Apply the smooth page transitions bettwen `Dashboard` and `Map`, I should be able to navigate the pages using swipes (left-right), thus the app feels much more like a sophisticated native app and not cheap html app
