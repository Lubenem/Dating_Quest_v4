# Prompts

[x] Map page
Added a third page - `Map`. Should be also available on the navbar
Integrate google maps (or some alterantive if easier and free), the map should show my current location as a dot

[x] Github pages installation fix
I am using github pages to test the app on my phone, there is a possibility to install the app, when I open it, but it doesn't work properly since our index.html is located not in the root folder `Dating_Quest` but in the sub folder `HTML_Cursor_DatingQuest`. Is there a ways of fixing this without moving html project to a root folder? Maybe we can add an index.html to a root folder that will redirect us correctly to our subfolder??

[x] Calendar and highlight fixes 
* when I touch on phone, it selects objects, not cool
* nav bar is dissapearing if I am clicking on different dates on calendar
* when I am on the calendar, I want to see data for one currently selected day at the bottom of the screen, neatly looking, not inside the date square
* I have move the proj folder to Dating_Quest, please proceed there
