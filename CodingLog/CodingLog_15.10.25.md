# [Prompts]

## <Map>
[] Add a simple map
* Create a simple react-native-map on the map page, which is empty right now
* The map should be focused at my current location with scale like 1000 meters (I should be able to configure this variable)
* There should be not re-loading each time I switch to map page, it should be loaded and focuesd on me just once, and then stay active like that even if it is not visible, let's not care much about the resources, the UX matters much more.
* Dark theme
