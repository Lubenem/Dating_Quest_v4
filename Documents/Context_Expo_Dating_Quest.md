* We are vibe coding a mobile app called the `DatingQuest`.
* Here is a simple game design document: <Documents\Design.md>
* We have a good app skelton developed by `ME & AI` in react, which we are replicating in expo
 - react app:  <OldVersions\ReactDatingQuest/>
* Also we have a first attempt at expo (v0.1) and we've decided to start over:
 - expo app v0.1: <OldVersions\ExpoDatingQuest\Expo_First_DatingQuest/>
Here is the current version of our expo app:
* current expo app v0.2: <ExpoDatingQuest/>
\
* In your code, solutions, decisions and explanations always respect: `KISS` and `DRY`
* !Important As Hell! | Always! Use! Best Practices! and common practices proposed by official documentations of packages and frameworks (or other reliable web resources, like Q/A forums), instead of just making up shitty solutions on the spot, browse the web and consult the docs. I will list some of them here:
